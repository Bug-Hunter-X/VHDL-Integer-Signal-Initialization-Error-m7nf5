This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in VHDL: incorrect initialization of integer signals with range constraints. The `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, where an integer signal is declared with a range but initialized without explicitly using the range operator. This can lead to unexpected behavior or synthesis issues. The `bugSolution.vhdl` file provides the corrected code, showcasing the proper way to initialize such signals.
